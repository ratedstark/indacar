# ForerunnerDB Chrome Extension
> This extension is currently under development and in an alpha state. Do not expect it to
contain useful functionality or provide a good user experience. It is provided as-is and
does not represent a final product. The following description and documentation relates to
 a finished product, not what is currently available or working.

The chrome extension allows you to access a local ForerunnerDB instance and inspect it's
databases, collections and properties, run operations interactively and query for data. You
can also see data-bound relationships between the DOM and ForerunnerDB allowing you to 
visually match data to elements on screen in realtime.
